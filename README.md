### Prerequisites

### Run Locally

To run **J4E** locally, run this command on your git bash:

```You cannot use J4E without an API key.

Why do I need this? We cannot use a private API key due to rate limits and privacy. You can find your api key at: https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

But, there is a solution! If you go to this replit: https://replit.com/@alphaotuken/ChatGDP-Unblocked?v=1 and enter the link above, you can login to your account and find or create your API Key. For any issues you can check.
```
